# Fix and Failing Tests and Lint Errors
## Overview

You are to run the tests of the frontend and backend with coverage enabled to ensure that both all tests are passing and the neccessary coverage is reached. You are also responsible for running the linter in both the frontend and backend to ensure that all linter errors have been handled accordingly

## Steps

1. Run the frontend tests with coverage and improve coverage where needed and fix any failing tests
2. Run the frontend linter and fix any linting errors that appear
3. Run the backend tests with coverage and improve coverage where needed and fix any failing tests
4. Run the backend linter and fix any linting errors that appear

## Important

This task is not complete until all 4 steps have been completed and all test are passing, linter errors are resolved, and coverage is above 80% across all packages.
