# Break up Github Issue into Sub-tasks

## Overview

Use the Github MCP server (or the Github (gh) skill) to create a plan of execution for the provided Github issue (if a URL was provided, update the issue, otherwise create a new issue).

This should include multiple logical steps with interlinking dependencies to accomplish the acceptance criteria set in the Github issue.

Each sub-task should be a detailed description of the request, including the expected behavior, and any relevant context without getting into the details of the implementation with code.

One-at-a-time, ask for clarification on any details you are not 100% sure about.  The options should be listed as A, B, C, to make choosing easier.
