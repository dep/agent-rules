# Implement a Feature or Bugfix

## Overview

Use this command to implement a feature or bugfix.

0. If on the `main` branch, create a new branch for the feature or bugfix, otherwise ask the user if they want to create a new branch for the feature or bugfix or use the current branch.
1. Use the Github MCP server (or the Github (gh) skill) to understand the requirements of the feature or bugfix. If the user did not provide a Github issue URL, create a new issue with the details of the feature or bugfix.
2. Don't assume you know everything about the request and ask for clarification on any details you are not 100% sure about.
3. When you feel satisfied with the requirements, use the @test-driven-development skill to write the test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass.
4. Once you are satisfied with the test and implementation, use the @test-and-lint command to run the tests and lint the code.
5. If the tests or linting fail, fix the issues and repeat the process until the tests and linting pass.
6. Once the tests and linting pass, use the @open-pr command to open a pull request with the changes in DRAFT mode.
