# Report a Feature Enhancement
## Overview
A feature enhancement request has come in from a customer and your task is to create a github issue for tracking the feature request. If a feature request is already created for the request, add a "+1" comment on the existing issue to indicate that it's being requested again.

## Process
1. Gain an understanding of the feature request
2. Use the Github MCP server to find any existing issues for this request
3. If one exists, add a "+1" comment on it, if not, create a new feature request issue using the MCP server
